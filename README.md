# tnimporter
A script that handles tedius setup tasks for the technology report section of the Wikipedia Signpost.

<h2>About</h2>

The "Technology report" (or the tech report for short) is a report published as a part of the weekly "Wikipedia Signpost", a community-organized and -written internal newspaper on the English Wikipedia that covers the Wikipedia movement at large. This report deals with various tech news replaced to Wikipedia, MediaWiki, and the Wikimedia movement at large.

The tech report has not had a regular writer in a while and so most Wikipedians have come to rely on another smaller-format report, Tech/News, to get their information (hosted at https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tech/News). This script actually takes the contents of that report and pastes them into Signpost tech news alongside documentation of the report's origin.

<h2>Installation</h2>

* [Python 3.4.0](https://docs.python.org/3.4/)
* [Pywikibot](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot)
